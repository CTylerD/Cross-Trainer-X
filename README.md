# CrossTrainer X

---

## Personal Training App

Cross-Trainer X is a personal training app that provides users with a completely customized workout program. In the onboarding, users specify their experience level and select from one of three different workout tracks: Strength Training, Cardio (running or cycling), or Flexibility (yoga or stretching), which then generates an exercise library and populates all of the exercise attributes (sets, reps, distance, time, etc.) based on their given experience level.

After each exercise, the user is given a short 'Goldilocks' survey about each of the attributes of the current exercise, which will then update that exercise in their library. Once the current workout is completed, it is stored for later access and then a new workout is generated based on the current workout plan, which is then available for the user to view and complete as a part of their workout routine.

More information about how the workout generation algorithm works is available in the /backend .README.
